# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to play against the computer for a total of 5 rounds. After each round, the winner is displayed, and at the end of the 5 rounds, the final winner of the game is announced.

## Game Description

The game consists of two main sections: the user's choice and the computer's choice. The user can select either rock, paper, or scissors by clicking on the corresponding button. The computer's choice is determined randomly. After each round, the result is evaluated, and the winner is determined based on the game rules.

The game features include:

- **User Score**: Keeps track of the user's score throughout the game.
- **Computer Score**: Keeps track of the computer's score throughout the game.
- **Winner Round**: Displays the winner of each round or indicates a tie.
- **Winner Game**: Displays the final winner of the game after completing 5 rounds.
- **Reset Button**: Allows the user to restart the game.

Please note that this game follows the traditional Rock Paper Scissors rules, where rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

## Technologies Used

The game is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the game elements.
- SCSS: A CSS preprocessor that enhances the styling capabilities by adding features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
- BEM (Block Element Modifier): A naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS to create reusable and modular code.
- JavaScript: Programming language for implementing game logic and interactivity.

## Workflow

During the development of this project, the following workflow was followed:

1. Utilized GULP: GULP is a task runner that helps automate repetitive tasks during the development process. It was used to enhance the development workflow and streamline the build process.

2. SCSS Styling: SCSS (Sass) was used to write the CSS code in a more organized and maintainable manner. It allowed for the use of nesting making the styling process more efficient.

3. BEM Methodology: BEM (Block Element Modifier) was employed to create a clear and modular structure for the CSS code. It provided a consistent naming convention for classes, making it easier to understand and modify the styles.


## Acknowledgments

This game project is inspired by the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors and serves as a fun demonstration of JavaScript programming concepts.
